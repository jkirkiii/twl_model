Preliminary exploration of simulation outputs 
    Initially tested extracting TWL of grid cells and sorting by UTM coordinates with grid reference index
    Discovered element index in output files, updated script to utilize native indices
    Updated script to output multiple data formats during exploratory phase

Updated script to handle multiple .nc files
    *** Questions:  Relationship between nNetElem, nFlowElem, FlowElem_xcc and FlowElem_ycc?
                    x/y coordinates are circumcenter?
                    are the FlowElem grids output in the same order in each simulation?
